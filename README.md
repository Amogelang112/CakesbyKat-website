CakesbyKat: Artisanal Bakery Website

Technologies Used
 * HTML5 & CSS3: Used for semantic structure, layout (Flexbox), and Responsive Design.
 * Vanilla JavaScript: Used to implement all required interactive elements (AJAX Form, Lightbox, Map).
 * Leaflet.js: An open-source JavaScript library used for the Interactive Map display.

Advanced Features & Interactive Elements
This project fully meets the JavaScript Enhancements requirement by implementing the following advanced features:
1. AJAX Form Submission with Validation (Contact Page)
 * Feature: The "Custom Order Form" on contact.html uses Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) via fetch() to submit data without refreshing the page.
 * Implementation: The submission handler in script.js includes robust client-side validation to check all required inputs (Name, Email, Cake Flavor, Cake Size, etc.) before submission. The successful submission currently posts to a static testing endpoint (https://httpbin.org/post).

2. Leaflet Interactive Map (About Page)
 * Feature: An embedded, interactive map displays the bakery's location in Houghton Estate, Johannesburg.
 * Implementation: The Leaflet.js library is used to initialize the map on the about.html page, centering it on the coordinates -26.1772, 28.0673 and adding a location marker.

3. Lightbox Image Gallery (Products Page)
 * Feature: The product images on the products.html page can be clicked to open a larger version in a modal overlay, providing a smooth gallery viewing experience without navigating away from the page.
 * Implementation: Vanilla JavaScript targets images with the class="gallery-img" attribute and displays the high-resolution source from the data-full attribute.

SEO & Project Files (Mandatory Requirements)
The project includes all mandatory files and meta-data:
 * Unique Meta Descriptions: Every HTML file (index.html, about.html, products.html, specials.html, testimonials.html, contact.html) contains a unique, descriptive <meta name="description" ...> tag in the <head>.
 * robots.txt: Created in the root directory to instruct all search engine crawlers to crawl the site.
 * sitemap.xml: Created in the root directory to provide search engines with a clear map of all available pages on the website.

Testing
 * Responsiveness: Tested across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints using Chrome Developer Tools.
 * Validation: HTML validated with W3C HTML Validator and CSS validated with W3C CSS Validator.
